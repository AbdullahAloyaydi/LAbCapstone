# SpaceX's Falcon 9 Launches

Project Overview
SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than competitors, who charge over $165 million. This cost efficiency is largely due to the reuse of the rocketâ€™s first stage. By predicting the likelihood of a successful landing, this project aims to better understand launch costs and support competition with SpaceX.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

DataCollectionAndWebscraping: Collecting launch data through web scraping.
DataWrangling: Cleaning and preparing the collected data for analysis.
ExploratoryDataAnalysis: Exploring the dataset to uncover insights and trends.
InteractiveVisualAnalytics: Visualizing data interactively using dashboards and maps.
PredictiveAnalysis: Building machine learning models to predict first-stage landing success.
This structure supports a comprehensive analysis of SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches, from data collection to predictive modeling.
